Arithmetic Operators
Question:
Write a Java program to input two integers and display their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

Bitwise Operators
Question:
Write a program to perform bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on two integers entered by the user, and print the binary results.

Relational Operators
Question:
Write a Java program to compare two numbers and print which one is greater or if they are equal.

Logical Operators
Question:
Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote — eligibility requires age ≥ 18 and citizenship = true (use logical AND).

 Assignment Operators
Question:
Write a program to demonstrate +=, -=, and *= operations on an integer variable and display the result after each operation.

Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Question:
Write a Java program that reads a number and uses the ternary operator to print whether it is even or odd.

Selection Statements
Question:
Write a Java program using an if-else statement to determine if an input number is positive, negative, or zero.

Iteration Statements
Question:
Write a program to print the multiplication table of a number using a for loop.

Module 4

Inheritance Basics

Exercise:

1.	Create a program where:
Employee class has attributes name and salary, and a method displayInfo().
Manager class inherits from Employee and has an extra attribute department.
Print all details using an object of Manager.

2.	Create a Shape class with a method displayShape().
Create two subclasses:
Circle with a method area() to calculate area of a circle.
Rectangle with a method area() to calculate area of a rectangle.
In main(), create objects of both subclasses and call methods.

3.	Create a Transport class → method move()
Bus class (extends Transport) → method carryPassengers()
Truck class (extends Transport) → method carryGoods()
Demonstrate hierarchical inheritance by creating both objects.

4.	Different doctors charge different consultation fees.
The base class Doctor has a method consultationFee().
➤ Override it in subclasses Dentist, Cardiologist, and Surgeon to show different fees.
